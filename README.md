# GT Bobby Dodd Stadium design  
This was a grad school project where we worked with Georgia Tech's athletic department to help them price tickets for the upcoming football season. My work involved creating the visualization, where we built an outline of GT's football stadium, where each section is shaded by a customer's willingness to pay for a given opponent/start time
